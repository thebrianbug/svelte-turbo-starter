Tech Stack:

- Frontend: Svelte 5 (Svelte 5 syntax only) + TypeScript, Vite v6, TailwindCSS v3
- Backend: PostgreSQL with Docker/Podman, Drizzle ORM
- Architecture: Domain-driven design, Modular structure (UI, BLL, DB layers)
- Testing: Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E
- Quality: TypeScript v5, ESLint (security, promise, sonar, unicorn plugins), Prettier with Svelte plugin
- Node.js >=18, NPM 10

Testing Notes:

- ts-mockito is used for mocking in unit tests
- Follow TDD principles: write tests first, then implementation
- Place unit tests next to source files with .test.ts extension
- E2E tests go in the tests/ directory of each app
